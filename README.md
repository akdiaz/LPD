## Line Recognizer (Liner)
`Liner` detects the lines present in a spectrum and identify them by comparing their frequencies against those of *known-lines*.  
Needs a spectrum file (formated like the ones generated by [CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu/)) and a text file with the *known-lines* (formated like those generated by [Splatalogue](https://splatalogue.online//). See examples below.

### Usage:

To run `Liner` you need Pyhton 3 and the script `liner.py`. The command

```
pyhton3 liner.py
```

will run the script with the default values. This will produce a text file (called "detected-lines.txt") with the identified lines and their peak properties (velocity, frecuency and flux/intensity), and a plot (a .png file with the same name of the input spectrum file) with useful information, both inside a subfolder named "output" by default. If you pass several spectra to the script, you will get one plot per spectrum but only one file with the information of all the lines detected. The *name* of the lines includes a reference to the spectrum on which they were found.

For example, if you analyse the spectra in the input files "spw_0.txt" and "spw_3.txt" (containing one CO line each), you will get an output text file (named "detected-lines.txt") like this:

```
# Spectrum_Peak_ID	Species	Transition	Teorical_Frequency	Redshifted_Frequency	Peak_frequency_(MHz)	Peak_Velocity_(km/s)	Peak_Flux_density_(Jy)
spw0_0 13COv=0 J=3-2,F=5/2-5/2 330587.867100 330587.867100 330587.387762 0.528000 7.513535
spw0_0 13COv=0 J=3-2,F=5/2-3/2 330587.949000 330587.949000 330587.387762 0.528000 7.513535
spw0_0 13COv=0 3-2 330587.965300 330587.965300 330587.387762 0.528000 7.513535
spw0_0 13COv=0 J=3-2,F=7/2-5/2 330587.981600 330587.981600 330587.387762 0.528000 7.513535
spw3_0 COv=0 3-2 345795.989900 345795.989900 345795.840051 0.130000 53.377550
```
and two plots like these (named "spw_0.png" and "spw_3.png"):

![spw_0](https://github.com/akdiaz/LPD/blob/main/Help/spw0.png "spw_0")

![spw_3](https://github.com/akdiaz/LPD/blob/main/Help/spw3.png "spw_3")

In this case, `Liner` found one line (spw0_0) that could be any of the 13COv=0 listed, and another one (spw3_0) that could be COv=0 3-2, whose peaks are marked in the plot as red dots, and the frequency of the posible lines are marked with blue lines.

There are several options you can set to control the behavior of `Liner`. You can view a list of them with

```
python3 liner.py -h
```
which produces

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t FREQUENCY_TOLERANCE, --frequency_tolerance FREQUENCY_TOLERANCE
                        Frequency tolerance (in the frequency units of the
                        input spectrum). If a detected line has a known line
                        with a frequency separation less than
                        <<frequency_tolerance>>, it will assume its ID, if
                        not, will remain unidentified (U). (default: 2)
  -w LINE_WIDTH, --line_width LINE_WIDTH
                        Line width (in the velocity units of the input
                        spectrum). Local peaks closer than <<line_width>> will
                        be considered as belonging to the same line, and only
                        the one with higher flux will be returned. (default:
                        20)
  --snr SNR             Signal-to-noise ratio. Only peaks with flux higher
                        than <<SNR>> will be returned (default: 5)
  -s SPECTRUM_FILE_NAME [SPECTRUM_FILE_NAME ...], --spectrum_file_name SPECTRUM_FILE_NAME [SPECTRUM_FILE_NAME ...]
                        Name of the file (including extension) with the
                        spectrum to analyse. (default: spectrum_golden.txt)
  -l KNOWN_LINES_FILE_NAME, --known_lines_file_name KNOWN_LINES_FILE_NAME
                        Name of the file (including extension) with the known
                        lines. (default: lines.txt)
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Name of the output folder. (default: output)
  --vlsr VLSR           Source radial velocity (local standard of rest) in
                        km/s. (default: 0)
```

## How it works:
1. Finds the lines in the spectrum whose peaks are above a certain threshold (provided by --snr) and that are separated in velocity more than certain value (provided by -w). These are the *detected lines*.
3. Looks up in the text file containing the *known-lines* and
   - redshifts the teorethical frequencies according the velocity of the source (provided by --vlsr).
   - finds those lines that have redshifted frequencies inside the frequency range of your spectrum. These are the *expected lines*. 
4. Matches each *detected line*, with **all** the *expected lines* that are closer in frequency than certain value (provided by -t).
5. Returns the output files (see above).

## Examples:

**Runing for multiple files:**
```
python3 liner.py -s spw0.txt spw3.txt 
```
will run `Liner` in the files "spw0.txt" and "spw3.txt" in your current folder.

```
python3 liner.py -s *.txt 
```
will run `Liner` in all the .txt files in your current folder.

### Additional:
Run `get_spectrum_CASA.py` inside CASA 6.1 to take the spectrum in a cube image, in a region defined by a mask image. Needs the cube and the mask, both in FITS format. Assumes that the cube is endnamed '.image.pbcor.fits' and the mask '.mask.fits' (following the standard nomeclature of the product images generated by the ALMA pipeline). It will process in the same run all the '.image.pbcor.fits' in your current folder that have not empty masks.

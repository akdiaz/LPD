## Line Recognizer (Liner)
Liner detect the lines present in a spectrum and identify them by comparing their frequencies against those of 'known lines'.  
Needs a spectrum file (formated like the ones generated by CASA) and a file with the 'known lines'.
 
### Additional:
Run get_spectrum_CASA.py inside CASA 6.1 to take the spectrum in a cube image, in a region defined by a mask image. Needs the cube and the mask, both in FITS format.
